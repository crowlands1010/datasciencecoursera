## This assignment is to write a pair of functions that will cache
## the inverse of a matrix. The purpose of this assignment is to
## fulfill the requirements set forth in the second assignment in 
## the R Programming course on Coursera.

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## cacheSolve: This function is to compute the inverse of the special matrix
## returned by the above function, makeCacheMatrix. If the inverse has already
## been calculated, then cacheSolve should retrieve inverse from cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
